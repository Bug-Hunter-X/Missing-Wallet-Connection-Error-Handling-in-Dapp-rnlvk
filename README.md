# Missing Wallet Connection Error Handling in Dapp

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dapps: the lack of robust error handling when checking for wallet connection.  The `bug.js` file shows the faulty code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

The original code simply checks for the presence of the `ethereum` object, without accounting for the scenario where MetaMask is installed but not connected. This can lead to unpredictable application behavior.

The solution incorporates more comprehensive error handling, providing clear feedback to the user and preventing potential crashes.
